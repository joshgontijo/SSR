# Simple Java EE / Spring service registry

## What's this
A simplistic key-value that store that allows service 
to register its services endpoints for discovery.

## But why ?
No reason to use this project apparently, but developers always 
trying to build their own things. Consul, etcd and other are much better options.

## How it works ?
It's based on websockets server and client that connect to each other 
in order to stabilish who's connected.
